            <p>Sapien was built on the idea of informed consent, education, personal relationships, and meticulous esthetics practices to make you feel empowered to look and feel the way you want to.</p>

            <p>Here at Sapien, we care more about peer-reviewed studies and best practices, and less about staying on trend with clean beauty and buzz words designed to make you buy things you don’t need to solve problems that don’t exist. After hundreds of rave reviews and transformations, both inside and out, we are proud of what we have built along with our community of like-minded Homo sapiens.</p>
