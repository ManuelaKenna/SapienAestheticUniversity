              Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy, aka photofacial, is a way to improve the color and texture of your skin without surgery. It can undo some of the visible damage caused by sun exposure â€” called photoaging. You may notice it mostly on your face, neck, hands, or chest where your skin has been exposed to light the most.

              IPL is indicated if you have red, brown, or splotchy skin and have relatively fair skin..
